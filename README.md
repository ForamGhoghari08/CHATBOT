# Chatbot Project

This is a simple chatbot web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with a bot, which responds to various prompts and queries. The bot is equipped with predefined responses and can also generate random replies to unknown inputs. Additionally, the chatbot provides text-to-speech functionality to speak out responses.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: The user can type messages, and the bot responds.
- **Predefined Responses**: The chatbot has a set of predefined responses for common questions like greetings, weather inquiries, etc.
- **Random Replies**: For inputs that don't match any predefined response, the bot provides random replies.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The bot speaks its responses using the Web Speech API.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
